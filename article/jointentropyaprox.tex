\begin{abstract}
This paper proposes a method for to get an approximation of the joint entropy
of $M$ correlated binary sources; the approximation gets a linear calculation complexity 
in relation to the number of sources. 
Here, it is used a correlating model with a common
binary source that through $M$ binary symmetric channels in parallel
to obtain  the $M$ correlated binary sources.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Intro}
 
 
This paper is organized as follows. The model system and some definitions 
used in this work are presented in Section \ref{sec:SystemModel}, the current method for to get the joint entropy is presented in Section \ref{sec:Joint}, in this line a new method for to get
the joint entropy is described in Section \ref{sec:NewJoint}. 
The test of the for to get the joint entropy is presented in Section \ref{sec:Test}
Some demonstrations
need for to solve the last sections are presented in
Section \ref{sec:Appendix} and Section \ref{sec:Conclusions} concludes the paper 
with some final remarks.
